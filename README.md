## Features

Chats can be added to existing characters. If there is no character with the given name, a new character will be created. If a system prompt is present, it will be added to the new character as a character-specific system prompt.

Text chats can be imported, but the media will not be available in SillyTavern. Reasoning blocks are imported if they are present.

### My chat won't import

Please open an issue and attach the chat export with the message texts removed.
